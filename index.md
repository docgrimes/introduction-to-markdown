### Adding a code example - not sure when or how to use this later so I'm just using the example
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
Evidently adding triplet accent marks offsets something and shows the code instead of executing it

Not sure where I'm supposed to be adding the checklist, but here goes

- [ ] Turn on GitHub Pages
- [ ] Outline my portfolio
- [ ] Introduce myself to the world
- [ ] Adding lines and such these boxes are treated like bullets and are auto-added
